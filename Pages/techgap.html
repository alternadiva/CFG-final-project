                    <p>The pandemic showed us how vital technology is in our modern society. It allowed us to continue to do our jobs, kept children learning and allowed us to stay connected with our loved ones.</p>

                    <p>Technology shapes every part of our daily lives, from asking Alexa what the weather is, to checking our route on Citymapper, to answering endless emails and allowing us to keep up to date with the latest Netflix series.</p>

                     <p>One thing many people don’t think about however, is who shapes the technology that shapes us? And what happens when the people shaping the technology don’t necessarily have the same experiences as those using it.</p>

                    <p>For example, research by Caroline Criado Perez for her book, Invisible Women, found the average smartphone is 5.5 inches long, which is too big for most women’s hands. Criado Perez also found that speech-recognition software is trained on recordings of male voices meaning Google’s version is 70% more likely to understand men.</p>

                <p>As our reliance on technology grows, there will be more and more examples of women being overlooked when it comes to product design. The only way to change this is to ensure we get women in the room when technology is being designed and developed.</p>

                <h2>#gethercoding is a resource to help women learn why the tech gap affects us more than we might think, and to encourage them to use our resources to try and make that change!</h2>
