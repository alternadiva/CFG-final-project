## Our Mission

> At #getHerCoding we believe the future of tech is female. As technology becomes more and more integral in our everyday lives, it becomes clearer that we need women and girls to shape the technology around us. Over a quarter of female students say they’ve been put off a career in technology as it’s too male dominated, but this leaves the technology sector as a whole worse off. Our mission is to inspire women to consider a career as a software engineer or developer, and to give them the resources to start the journey.
